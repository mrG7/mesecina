        Main sections of the Mesecina user interface:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Vizualization widget</b> - the biggest part of the main window, is a viewport
            to a scene in which one can navigate to study the geometric structures.</li>
        <li><b>Layers</b> - a list of available geometric structures which can be included in
            the scene. Whenever a layer is checked, the corresponding geometric structures are
            going to be introduced in the scene. They are computed lazilly, the first time they
            are requested, but after that they are stored in the memory for fast interaction.</li>
        <li><b>Bundles</b> - bundles are collections of layers. They are means to store scene
            settings which are often used. By clicking on a bundle one can activate it and set
            the layer configuration which was saved into the bundle</li>
        <li><b>Slider</b> - the big slider on the top is used for procedural manipulation of
            the geometric structures. One can use an evolution in the combo box and then use
            the slider to apply the corresponding evolution on the geometries. Again lazy computation
            is available, only layers which are selected are going to be computed, but at any
            time one can compute additional structures using the</li>
        <li><b>Record</b> - the menu and the button on the top of the main window allows you
            export images, or sequences of images of the scene which is currently viewed</li>
        <li><b>Kernel</b> - one can choose the arithmetic kernel used for all geometric algorithms.
            The double is faste but certain algorithm will fail returning a useful result. The
            CORE::Expr kernel's exact arithmetic is slower but computes precise results.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Note that you can resize all the sections of the mainwindow by moving the splitter
        edges. All your settings regarding window positions, sizes, splitters will be saved
        between application settings

    <h2>

    </h2>
    <p>
        Layers represent geometric structures and when they are checked then they are visualized
        in the scene. If the structures needed for the layer are not available in the memory
        they will be computed when the used checkes them in. Notice that layers which were
        already computed and are in the memory will be displayed with darker color in the
        layer's list.
    </p>
    <p>
        One can change the properties od the layers by rightclicking on their name and using
        the available options. One can change color, opacity, point size, line width and
        such properties.
    </p>
    <p>
        The order of the layers determine in which order are they rendered in the scene.
        The lower a layer is in the list the later it will be rendered, therefore the "closer"
        it will be the user. Use <b>SHIFT + drag and drop on the list to reorder layers</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        After configuring a scene with several layers and properties one can save the whole
        configuration in a bundle for later use. For this use the combo box and the button
        on the bottom of the layers list. Once a bundle saved it will be introduced in the
        bundles list and saved on the hard disk, so one can use bundles across application
        sessions. To activate a layer simply click on it in the bundles list. One can <b>reorder</b>
        (SHIFT + drag and drop) or <b>rename bundles</b> (doubleclick on the name). Right
        clicking on a bundle brings up a context menu, where one can <b>delete</b> or <b>export</b>
        a bundle to a file.
    </p>
    <p>
        One can import bundles from files in the Bundle -> Import bundles... menu, or one
        can export all available bundles using Bundles -> Export bundles...

    <p>
        Here is a list of layers available and explanation of what they mean. Some layers
        are prefixed with A or P. These are layers which are computed based on the set of
        poles of all voronoi vertices/balls. A refers to all voronoi vertices/balls, P refers
        to polar vertices/balls.

        or view animations after structures have been computed.
