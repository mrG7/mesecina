This software allows you to visualize and study the medial axis and related computational geometry structures. It is great for exploring computational geometry structures for educational purposes and it is a very useful tool supporting computational geometry research.

**This sourcecode relies on [CGAL](http://www.cgal.org) and [Qt](http://qt.nokia.com/products/), contains a version of [libqglviewer](http://www.libqglviewer.com/) and a preliminary version of Christophe Delage's 2d Moebius diagram. Thank you to these projects!**

Feel free to use it for research and educational purposes, but it cannot be used for commercial purposes.

See the DeveloperEnvironment wiki page on a couple of notes about how to get Mesecina compile on your machine.

**Update:** (05 March 2011) The complete Mesecina codebase has been updated to the latest version. This includes both 2d and 3d versions, the 2d and 3d scale axis implementations. It is the working day-to-day research code, without any special cleanup and extra effort on documentation and help. Feel free to contact the owner of the project for questions.

**Update:** (30. October 2009) A current snapshot of the source code was added to the source repository. It is a snapshot of a daily development version, so be prepared for possible "hickups". **This version does not contain the 3d scale axis algorithm**. A new version will be uploaded soon with the complete 3d scale axis implementation.



I would be delighted if you would let me know for what you use Mesecina, just contact me using the email address from http://www.balintmiklos.com Thank you!
